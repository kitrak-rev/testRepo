## Blog: Are Open Book Assessments Better Than Closed Book Assessments?

In the ongoing debate about educational assessments, a pertinent question arises: Are open book assessments better than closed book assessments? This debate pits the proponents of open book exams, often seen as more practical and reflective of real-world scenarios, against the supporters of closed book exams, who argue for deeper understanding and retention of knowledge. Recently, a debate on this very topic saw the opposition team, "Turn the Table," emerge victorious over the pro-open book team, "Mavericks." Letâ€™s delve into the arguments presented by both sides and understand why the opposition prevailed.

### Points from the Pro-Open Book Team: Mavericks

1. **Assessment for Real-Life Scenarios:**
   - Mavericks argued that assessments should prepare individuals for real-life scenarios, which often involve stress management and time constraints.
   
2. **Managing Stress and Malpractice:**
   - Speaker 1 highlighted that open book exams could reduce exam stress and lower the chances of malpractice. 

3. **Hybrid Model:**
   - Mavericks suggested a hybrid model combining closed and open book formats to ensure fairness and maintain a level playing field.
   
4. **Incentives for Early Finishers:**
   - The team proposed additional points for students who finish exams early, encouraging efficiency and time management.

5. **Reference for Level Playing Field:**
   - Open book assessments provide a level playing field by allowing all students access to the same reference materials during the exam.
   
6. **Institutional Examples:**
   - Speaker MIT TOC, Harvard Law, and IIT examples were cited, where open book exams are successfully implemented to encourage critical thinking and application-oriented learning.

### Points from the Opposition Team: Turn the Table

1. **Encourages Deep Understanding and Retention:**
   - Closed book exams require students to internalize the material, promoting deeper understanding and long-term retention of knowledge.

2. **Promotes Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving Skills:**
   - Without access to notes, students must rely on their comprehension and critical thinking skills, valuable in real-life scenarios where resources may not be readily available.

3. **Reduces Dependence on Resources:**
   - In many real-world situations, immediate access to resources is not possible. Closed book exams prepare students for such scenarios by testing their ability to recall and apply knowledge independently.

4. **Fairness and Equality:**
   - Closed book exams create a more level playing field by eliminating advantages from access to high-quality notes or textbooks during the exam.

### Rebuttal from Turn the Table

1. **Superficial Learning and Reduced Retention:**
   - Turn the Table cited a study from the Journal of Educational Psychology (2015), which found that students in open book exams often skim materials rather than engage in comprehensive and critical thinking, leading to reduced retention of knowledge.

2. **Case Study from Delhi University:**
   - Delhi University's experience with open book exams during the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted accessibility issues and student unpreparedness, leading to a reversion to traditional exams.

3. **Stress and Well-Preparedness:**
   - The opposition argued that the root issue of exam anxiety is not the format but rather the level of preparation and support provided to students.

4. **Professional Field Relevance:**
   - In high-stakes environments like finance, quick, informed decision-making is crucial. Closed book exams help develop the ability to recall and apply knowledge under pressure, an essential skill for professionals.

### Conclusion: Why the Opposition Won

1. **More Comprehensive Use of Statistics:**
   - Turn the Table provided a wealth of statistics and case studies to support their arguments, making their points more compelling.

2. **Effective Rebuttal:**
   - The opposition team effectively countered the proponents' arguments, addressing the concerns about stress and preparedness with well-researched rebuttals.

3. **Engaging the Judges:**
   - Turn the Table kept the judges engaged with clear, concise arguments and a strong conclusion that recapped their main points.

In conclusion, while open book assessments have their merits in promoting application-oriented learning and reducing exam stress, closed book assessments arguably provide a more robust measure of deep understanding, critical thinking, and long-term knowledge retention. The debate underscores the importance of a balanced approach, possibly incorporating elements of both formats, to best prepare students for real-life challenges and professional demands.
